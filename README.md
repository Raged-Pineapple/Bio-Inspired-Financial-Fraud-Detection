This project combines biological models, machine learning, and real-time analytics to detect and prevent fraudulent behavior on blockchain networks. Inspired by nature's adaptability, each model in this suite mimics biological mechanisms to identify, simulate, and stop fraud as it spreads.

## 🧠 Key Modules

### 🔬 1. Infection Engine (SIR Model)

Simulates the spread of fraud like a virus:

- Safe → Infected → Recovered
- Network graph animation

---

### 🍄 2. Mold Growth Algorithm

Models "mold agents" that spread along optimal transaction paths:

- Helps find corruption corridors
- Inspired by slime mold network building

---

### 🧬 3. Stellar DNA

Encodes behavior as digital genomes:

- Mutation = sudden risk
- Tracks evolution of accounts over time

---

### 🕷️ 4. Spider Web Mapper

Creates an interactive graph of transactions:

- Flags suspicious node patterns
- Expands as new transactions load

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning

We use supervised classification (Random Forest & SVM) to detect anomalies based on:

- Frequency of transactions
- Amount variance
- Connected components
- Account type (new, recurring, previously flagged)

Trained on labeled fraud data. Integrated with dashboard to auto-flag high-risk nodes.

## 🧑‍💻 Admin Dashboard

Central hub to:

- View real-time fraud maps
- Flag, quarantine, or allow accounts
- Load data manually or from API
- Trigger mold/infection simulations
